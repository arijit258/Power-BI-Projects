# Zomato Restaurants Analysis (Power BI)

## Overview
This project leverages **Power BI** to analyze the Zomato restaurant dataset, providing interactive visualizations and insights into restaurant trends, pricing, ratings, and geographical distribution. The analysis helps in understanding key factors that influence restaurant popularity and customer preferences.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Zomato, containing information such as:
- Country Name
- Country ID
- Year
- Quarter
- Month
- Day
- month/year
- Day
- Name
- Month
- Financial month
- financial quarter

## Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing or inconsistent data.
- Create interactive dashboards to explore trends and patterns.
- Visualize key metrics such as ratings distribution, pricing variations, and popular cuisines.
- Identify top-rated restaurants and factors contributing to high ratings.
- Compare restaurant availability across different cities/countries.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Excel/CSV**: Data storage and preprocessing
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Custom calculations and measures
- **Power Query**: Data transformation

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Import the dataset into Power BI.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format data types using Power Query.
3. **Data Modeling**: Create relationships between tables if necessary.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Distribution of restaurant ratings
   - Analysis of average cost trends
   - Most popular cuisines
   - City-wise restaurant distribution
5. **Dashboard Creation**: Design interactive visuals and reports using Power BI.
6. **Insights & Conclusion**: Summarize findings and suggest potential applications.

## Results & Findings
- Restaurants with higher ratings often have a certain cuisine preference.
- The average cost for two varies significantly by city and country.
- Some cuisines are more popular in certain regions.
- Online delivery services influence restaurant popularity.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate real-time data for up-to-date analysis.
- Implement predictive analytics using Power BI's AI capabilities.
- Develop a web-based interface to share interactive reports.
